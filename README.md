# SeqMAB environmental monitoring
Algorithms (Seq(GP-UCB-SW), Seq(GP-UCB-CD)) and test scripts for SeqMAB environmental monitoring

## Requires
- Python3
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- R (only Seq(GP-UCB-CD))
- cpm(R library, only Seq(GP-UCB-CD))

## Usage
Test scripts regarding two synthetic scenarios have been included together with the algorithms.
Instructions are present as comments within the scripts
